# CrappyGames
This small, goofy project came out of a promise I jokingly made to a few friends. We had been wanting to make a game for a while but none of our ideas were really sticking, and we decided we just needed to make _something_ to get used to working together and prove that we could do it. As a bit of an ultimatum I told them we'd do it by the end of whatever weekend "even if it's just 'press x to shit your pants'".

...Unfortunately everyone else ended up being busy, so on Sunday I built 2 pants-pooping minigames alone.
