Originally put together using the Jekyll blog framework, then re-built from scratch using React/Redux. The usecase for Redux is slightly contrived, but I included it as a learning experience and an easy way to manage global state (in this case the devlog posts).

Overall I found React/Redux much easier to learn and more enjoyable to write and test than frameworks I've used in the past (Backbone with Mustache). As someone who was trained on more traditional application and systems programming, it was surprisingly intuitive and I didn't have any issues with the paradigm-shift like I've struggled with a bit during past web-dev experiences.
