I originally got into computer science as a kid because I wanted to make video games (typical) but once I tried it out I realized that I actually just love programming. I'm most interested in Artificial Intelligence of any kind, especially game AI. It's disappointing that difficulty levels are based around how much the AI cheats instead of actual levels of intelligence, so I'd love to help change that.

In school I learned a lot of application programming, but post-graduation I've worked exclusively on webdev. I didn't really enjoy it at first, but once I understood the paradigm shift, it actually ended up being pretty fun. I've still got a few knowledge gaps around styling (as you can see from this website) but for the most part I get what's going on. If I'm being honest I still prefer the process around creating stand-alone apps, but that might be because I feel more comfortable in that space.

#### Personal
##### Passion Projects
At the moment my favorite pet project would have to be narcov, a chatbot I wrote for the discord channel my friends and I use (you can read more about it [here](https://threedliams.github.io/projects/narcov) or view the repo [here](https://github.com/threedliams/CallbackBot)). It's been a blast to build and provides virtually endless entertainment as markov-generated messages are always hilarious.

I love making little games and apps. You can read more about the rest of my projects [here](https://threedliams.github.io/projects).

##### Non-Programming Things

Other than programming I try to find enough time to play video games, as it helps me stay in touch with my friends from back home. CS:GO is my favorite multiplayer game, but my friends get bored of it pretty easily so we usually play whatever other shooter is currently popular. For solo games I prefer anything strategy-based or short indie experiences that won't suck up all my free time.

I love music -- I've played piano for 16 years. I almost exclusively play ragtime because it's so much fun and I really like the sound. My favorite kinds of music to listen to, however, are funk, disco, and old-school hip-hop. Since moving into my own place a few years ago, I've bought a bass and a set of turntables. Unfortunately, I'm not anywhere close to as good with those as I am with the piano, so ask me about them again when I'm 40.

Also I have the cutest cat in the universe. Her name is Simi.
