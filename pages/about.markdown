# About Ramsey
## Interests
#### Professional
I originally got into computer science as a kid because I really wanted to make video games (typical) but once I tried it out I realized that I really love programming. The area that I'm most interested in is Artificial Intelligence of all kind, but I'm especially interested in game AI. I think it kind of sucks that difficulty levels are based around how much you let the AI cheat instead of actual levels of intelligence and I'd love to help change that.

In school I learned a lot of application programming, but after graduating I've exclusively worked on webdev. At first I didn't really enjoy it, but once I got the paradigm shift it actually ended up being pretty fun. I've still got a few knowledge gaps around styling but for the most part I get what's going on. If I'm being honest I still enjoy the process around creating stand-along apps more, but that might be because I still feel more comfortable in that space.

#### Personal
##### Passion Projects
At the moment my favorite pet project would have to be narcov, a chatbot I wrote for the discord channel my friends and I use (You can read more about it [here](https://threedliams.github.io/#/projects/narcov) or view the repo [here](https://github.com/threedliams/CallbackBot)). It's been a blast to build and provides basically endless entertainment as markov-generated messages are almost always hilarious.

I love making little games and apps, you can read more about the rest of my projects [here](https://threedliams.github.io/#/projects).

##### Non-Programming Things
Other than programming I still try to find enough time to play video games, as it helps me keep in touch with my friends from back home. CSGO is my favorite multiplayer game although the rest of them get bored of it pretty easily so we usually play whatever other shooter is hot at the moment. For solo games I prefer anything strategy or short indie experiences so I don't suck up all my free time.

I love music and I've played piano for 16 years. I basically exclusively play ragtime because it's so much fun and I really like the sound. My favorite kinds of music are funk, disco, and old-school hip hop, so since I moved to my own place a few years ago I've bought a bass and a set of turntables. I'm not anywhere close to as good with those as I am with the piano though, so ask me about them again when I'm 40.

Also I have the cutest cat in the universe! Her name is Simi.
