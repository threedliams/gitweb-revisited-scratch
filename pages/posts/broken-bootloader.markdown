# Broken Bootloader
Starting this OS project I'm coming at it with the idea that I want to do as much from scratch as possible. Because of that I opted to write my own bootloader, which has been met with mixed results. As you can see I did get it to display some messages on the screen:

![welcome screen](/pages/assets/brokenBootloader/welcomeScreen.jpg)

As you can see it prints a welcome message and tells you that it's trying to enter protected mode. However somewhere on the way to protected mode I get this:

![fault](/pages/assets/brokenBootloader/fault.jpg)

So somewhere along the way there's an issue I still need to fix. I've since found some better resources though so hopefully I should have a working bootloader soon. I'll create a github repository for it and upload the code once it gets working. For now though there's not much to look at (and even less that works) so there's not much point in sharing it.
