# Why does Worms Rumble exist?

Seriously someone please tell me, I was introduced to this game yesterday and it has made me feel completely insane.

## What is the audience?
To quote the Steam store: _"Worms Rumble is Worms like you’ve never played it before..."_ or ever wanted to.

Who asked for this? Who out there is sitting at their computer thinking "My God I love worms, I only wish it was real time instead of boring old turn based"?

Is this supposed to capture the nostalgia of Worms players thirsting for the same exciting memorable characters in a new setting? I mean who can forget the fan favorite worm... w-worm they're just worms. Who cares if it's a battle royale, anyone who liked the original games is going to have no interest in this.

Is it supposed to bring a new young audience of #gamers to the Worms franchise, by... hitting them with the ol' bait and switch? If you actually manage to find this game fun and decide to go check out all the old Worms titles you're just going to be disappointed that they're nothing like this.

What is the point then???

It's a cash grab. Obviously. It's a completely souless cash grab. It's some exec saying "hmmmm what's popular, oh kids love battle royales let's do that". Nevermind the fact that Worms might as well already be a battle royale where you pick up weapons on the map and try to be the last worm/squad standing, no no. You have to be able to level up. You need to be able to collect currency. _It's gotta have skins_.

## Why does it look like this?
Visually, it's a mess. I get it, you've gotta have the eye catching skins to trick the kids into spending money, but is this really the best you had to offer?

Good Lord, we look terrible.

And these teeth, just... I don't even have anything clever to say. Just why.

Maybe this whole thing is supposed to be a joke? Is this a parody of what the games industry has become? Am I just missing the humor? Is that why the entire city looks like untextured assets someone found for free online?

Or are they leaving that open so that they can sell city skins later?

Whatever this game is supposed to be, it's making me lose my mind.

But hey, at least you can roll into a funny little ball. Guess it's not all bad.

## In conclusion
I think it's telling that despite the fact this studio has been putting out Worms games for almost 3 decades now, the only one people actually like and still play is Worms Armageddon from 1999.

Maybe it's time to move on.
