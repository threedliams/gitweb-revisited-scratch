# Why rebuild?
I mean if you've already got a working website, why rebuild it from the ground up? Waste of time, right? Well I've got a couple reasons:

1. The old site didn't really count, I just slapped a framework on and made a couple markdown blogposts. Nothing was done from scratch.
2. I wanted to try out `~*~React~*~` since it's the new hotness.
3. Despite building parts and pieces here and there, and despite _actively working as a webdeveloper_, I had never built a website from scratch before.

## Out with the old
My old github.io site used Jekyll (because it was recommended on the intro page) which worked... fine. I mean it worked great, if I typed something up and uploaded it into the right folder, it showed up on the internet so really what more can you ask for. But it felt limiting (everything revolved around blog posts -- what if I don't want my site to just be a blog?) and I didn't really feel like I was building anything or doing any actual web development (_spoiler: I wasn't_). It served me well in a time when I just wanted to slap something online but it's time to move on.

## In with the new
The new and hopefully improved site is built from scratch from the ground up (...plus a bunch of node modules but I'm not going to _completely_ reinvent the wheel). It's got different sections than just a blog and I feel confident enough to mess around with the different pieces since I built them and I know how they work. As of writing this there is essentially no styling because I know next to nothing about CSS but _I'm working on it_ and most importantly the groundwork of the site is in place and unit tested.  
#### (Which includes some flaws)
Anyone peeking at the source will probably notice that the design is a bit sub-optimal and that the redux use case is a bit contrived. That's because the drive of this was primarily a learning experience, so while there were probably better ways to do things, I did them this way to... learn how to do them this way. Sue me. (Or send me a message and tell me why things suck, I'd love to learn more).

## But don't lose your identity
I'm going to leave in my old posts from the previous blog. They're a few years old, probably not interesting, and definitely not really a good representation on my current projects/motivation/direction/etc. But who knows, in a few more years maybe they'll be fun to look back on.  
I also used Jekyll's blog format as an inspiration for the devlog section, because can you believe it markdown makes it way easier and faster to write posts than building a whole new React page.
