# Thoughts on New World
A few weeks ago I got into the most recent test wave for Amazon's upcoming MMO [New World](https://www.newworld.com). Here's my (somewhat belated) impression on how it was, but first a few
### Disclaimers:
1. At the time of writing this I am working for Amazon, although I'm not at all affiliated with Amazon Games. Hopefully the informal review comes across as unbiased as it felt when I was writing it.
2. There are going to be a lot of comparisons here to [World of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) or WoW since that's the MMO I've played the most. 
3. It should go without saying but everything in here is my personal opinion, not that of my employer or anyone I know. You might have liked things I didn't like, or disliked things I liked and that's fine.
4. This is the first time I've written something like this, so it almost definitely sucks.

Okay with that out of the way, let's get right into it.

## What I liked
### Overall concept
New World has a lot of ideas that really excite me, and the overall concept reminds me a lot of [Puzzle Pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle_Pirates), probably because it's the sandbox-style MMO I've played the most of. The sandbox-y elements that really hooked me into this game - the player driven economy, the focus on crafting, and being able to control territory and develop it if you're the faction in charge - all have great potential and remind me of the things I loved about playing Puzzle Pirates as a kid.

### Crafting
My favorite mechanic in any game is crafting. Don't ask me why, I have no idea - I just love clicking buttons and turning ingredients into objects until I get enough levels to turn advanced ingredients into hyper objects.

So my favorite thing about New World is that you can craft whatever you want, there's no picking just 2 professions or lockout of any kind, the only limiting factor is how much time you spend leveling up each track. That's... probably not exciting to everyone, but I am _into_ it.

### Kill stealing
There is none! I really enjoyed that even if you're not in a group, anyone working on the same enemy will get the quest progress + rewards for killing it. Really refreshing in the world of who-can-tag-it-first RPGs; it's nice to not have to stress about getting the first hit in, and it allows you to "group" without ever having to say a single word to another player. The dream of every introvert.

## What I didn't like
There's... a lot to unpack here, unfortunately. My notes are ~1/2 of a page of things I liked, and maybe 2 pages of things that didn't work for me.

By far the most glaring issue was the lack of enemy and quest variety. I stopped playing ~6 hours in and if I had to point to one thing, it would be the repetitiveness of it all. Every single quest I did (barely an exaggeration, there were maybe a handful of exceptions) followed this exact same format:

1. Kill X number of enemies
2. Y of them are going to drop an item you need to loot
3. Also, search Z chests while you're there for a different item

And I'm not saying there were 3 different quest templates, I'm saying _every quest had these exact same objectives_. Now don't get me wrong, I've definitely done my fair share of boring "just kill a bunch of enemies"-style RPG quests, but there's something about these that are especially egregious that I'm going to try to break down here:

### Quests are boring
#### Problem 0 - every quest is the same
Okay obviously let's just get this out of the way, if you design 50 of the same quest it's inevitable that they'll get boring and repetitive eventually. Even if it's the most fun concept in the world, there's only so many times you can do one thing in a row before it starts to grate on you. That being said, I think the quests themselves are flawed in other ways, for instance

#### Problem 1 - overlapping objectives
Take a look at the 3 objectives above and ask yourself: what is the point of having both 1 and 2? There was never a point in the time that I played where I didn't loot every item I needed from an enemy to complete 2 _far_ before I killed up to the cap I needed to complete 1. By including both of these objectives, the developers are already guaranteeing that I don't pay attention to or care about 1/3 of the quest. And since every quest is the same, I've basically just lost interest in 1/3 of the game.

#### Problem 2 - why is every quest multi-objective?
Very related to problem 1 - why even have so many 3-objective quests? Taking it back to WoW again, there were _plenty_ of times when multiple quests had you killing the same enemy, or at least questing in the same area. The big difference though is that they're all different quests with different objectives given to you by different people. It might seem like a shallow difference on the surface but I can tell you from experience that the feeling is totally different.

Sometimes you even have one quest that points you to an area where you're supposed to kill an enemy, and then while you're there someone you find gives you another objective on the same enemy. That amounts to the same outcome, but you feel like you've _discovered_ something. You explored thoroughly and got rewarded for it, and that's much more exciting and engaging.

#### Problem 3 - if everyone wants the same thing, nothing seems real
I was really excited about the world when I first started playing New... World. The opening hooks you in and leaves you with a ton of questions, but every quest I did made me care less and less and made it feel more like a game and less like a universe. Why do I care that objective 2 has a new name of some random material to collect I don't care about? Why do I care that this is a village instead of a shipwreck? Why do all these people with, one would assume if they were real, all these different motivations have the exact same tasks for me in different areas. All it made me thing is "oh I'm playing a game and they already ran out of ideas in the starting area". Nothing matters, there are no stakes, and while you're at it make sure you loot 6 chests around the docks.

### Combat
I actually originally had combat as a positive for the first few hours - so I will say that relative to other MMOs I found it pretty engaging from the outset. The problem is in most other games you start gaining skills, and the combat, while boring at the beginning, becomes more engaging and complicated over time. Not so in New World!

I found it engaging at first because of the action component. Do I need to block? Should I light or heavy attack? It felt like there were a lot of decisions to make early on. Then a few hours in you realize, oh all those decisions are meaningless and actually the best way to fight everything is to stunlock it by spamming light attacks. Nothing else matters. Sure there are skills, but you only get 3 of them at a time since they're tied to your weapon. And you can't really increase the variety by switching mid combat because they're on a global cooldown.

So instead of being like other RPGs where combat ramps up in complexity and difficulty as you go up in level, it actually goes down and becomes less engaging over time. Not the kind of curve you want if your game is supposed to have longevity.

### Enemies
I feel like I'm living in the late 2000s/early 2010s. You remember, right? Left 4 Dead just came out, and so did Dead Rising, and so did Plants vs Zombies and so did Dead Island and so di-- well anyways you get the picture.

Every single enemy in New World is a zombie. Okay sure there's like wolves and... turkeys and other wildlife but that only matters for the first 15 minutes of the game, after that you're killing zombie after slightly different zombie. Ohhhh but wait it's soooo different, they're not infected with a virus, they're infected with the \~\*\~corruption\~\*\~\.

From what I played there were 2 different basic groups of zombies - pirates and villagers. And within the villagers you have the melee ones and the ones that can spit green goo at you. Within the pirates you have your melee ones and the ones that can shoot a pistol. There are also demolition pirates and guys with 2 handed weapons but in the end, none of it feels that different.

Okay I get it, the story is that people keep crash landing on this island for whatever reason and getting corrupted. But is there no room for other things to be happening too? In WoW (here we go again) there are tons of story lines being interwoven together that make the world feel alive. Sure you do have literal zombies but you also have goblins and bandits and gnomes and gnolls and orcs and ogres and... you get the idea, the list goes on. Why only zombies? Why not have other mythical creatures roaming about? Why not have even regular humans that aren't corrupted but just don't like the status quo that the factions established when they arrived?

If there are other monsters, why hide them until later? I saw one drake-like monster while questing in addition to all those zombies, why did it take me 6 hours to see that? Just in the original dwarf starting zone in WoW you fight trogs, wolves, trolls and boars before you even leave the first camp. This is all only compounded by the fact that every single player is a human, you can't even run into other interesting friendly races. It's all the same.

### Lack of Direction
There are so many choices and so little information about the impact of them that I feel completely lost when it comes to speccing my character. On the one hand that's kind of intruiging, it's feels like it's very open ended and you can do whatever you want. On the other hand, I don't even know enough about what is there to know what I want.

In the majority of other RPGs you pick your race/class combo right off the bat. That, of course, locks you in to that combo for that character for the rest of forever, but it also tells you some things, like what weapon you'll be using, what stats you need, etc. Here everyone is the same dude, you just pick whatever weapons you like to use and start leveling up one of your general stats (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution). The game is clear what these stats do when you level them up, but there's no indication to what your focus should be.

I don't mean that it has to come out and say "if you want to min/max your character, put all your points in X". I mean that in other RPGs stats can be important later to be able to wear the right gear, use the right items, things like that. Is that not a factor? Very possibly, but there's no indication either way which makes it feel stressful until you say "screw it at least if I break my character it's only a preview" and start randomly throwing points around.

There's also a respec button, but there's no information associated with it, not even a tooltip. Is it free? Will it always be free? Is it only free because this is a preview? In WoW you can find someone in game that will respec your talents and they're very clear: it starts at 1 gold and goes up every time.

## What I found... weird
### Swimming
You can't swim.

You were a sailor of some kind, your boat crashed and you made it to the shore by...? Definitely not swimming. You know what's even crazier though? You can still enter the water, but instead of swimming you just... continue to walk on the floor of the ocean while you run out of breath. So I guess when the boat crashed you just ran to shore? Maybe the first symptom of the corruption is an extreme increase in density.

### Dialogue
At times the dialogue can be _really_ stiff and awkward. Check out this screenshot:

![I am Barkeep Polly](https://ramseyopp.com/pages/assets/newWorldThoughts/barkeepPolly.png)

"I am Barkeep Polly", really? Who talks like that? If I walked up to someone and introduced myself with "I am Programmer Ramsey" they'd slowly and carefully back away from me. It's like introducing yourself by your Pokémon trainer class, like "I am [Super Nerd](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Super_Nerd_(Trainer_class))".

Past that though, why does the whole thing sound like an advertisement? Where's any of the emotional impact? What I loved about (at least some) quests in WoW was that there was a meaningful backstory. "My business partner went missing", "My wife got left behind", "I'm really hungry for this specific pie" all of those felt more meaningful than "Hey do ya want some loot, boyo? `I am Barkeep Polly`". Even the completion text feels like it's breaking the 4th wall:

![Polly's rewards](https://ramseyopp.com/pages/assets/newWorldThoughts/pollyReward.png)

"Now that is quite the loot haul!" Remember, you're playing a game! Gotta get that loot! That Regent I didn't tell you about that I had no idea was there because I haven't left this bar never stood a chance!

When characters don't feel like they have real motivations, they don't feel like they're real people in the world. And when they don't feel like real people, no one cares what happens to them and you just stop reading the quest text and really engaging with the world outside of the loop of combat -> rewards -> harder combat. I think that's _okay_ for some games which is why I didn't put it under the "bad" category, but I think it can make it hard for some people to enjoy the game long term.

### Performance
Load times are **brutal** and on top of that the game seems to be constantly streaming from the hard drive. Here I am sitting at the edge of town doing nothing and it's blasting my CPU, reading ~23MB/s from the hard drive it's installed on, and basically maxing out my memory (and before you ask, no that's not the drive hosting my pagefile. That's on E:).

![What is going](https://ramseyopp.com/pages/assets/newWorldThoughts/highLoadTown.png)
![on with you](https://ramseyopp.com/pages/assets/newWorldThoughts/highLoadTaskManager.png)

It's still just preview so there's an excuse to not be perfectly optimized, but sitting in town was pretty rough on my system.

Also, the floor disappeared

### Aggro trains
Here's another problem WoW solved ages ago: aggro trains or "training". Basically one player, either intentionally or accidentally, aggros a bunch of enemies and runs away. Once they reach the edge of their range they start running back but if you happen to be close by you'll aggro all of them and also have to run away (or fight and die). WoW fixed it by forcing enemies to reset when losing aggro and go all the way back to their usual patrol path before becoming aggressive + attackable again, but it's been fully brought back to life in New World.

Is it because it's a preview? Or is this an intentional feature? Hard to say, but it definitely damages the player experience.

## Conclusion
New World lives up to its name in that it feels most exciting while it's brand New for the first hour or two. After that the cracks immediately start showing - the combat feels more shallow the more you use it, the quests are all cookie-cutter copies, the enemies are uninspired zombie clones, and there's no hints on what to do with your character.

It's a fascinating concept, and it's upsetting how many ideas are in there that I legitimately love the sound of on paper (crafting, housing, territory ownership, factions) that are overshadowed by the main game loop just not being fun to play. I would love to see more variety in the main game loop to support all the exciting ideas, but as it stands right now I don't think I would pay money to play this when it's released.
